HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; was supposed to be awesome, powerful, and fun.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
But browser vendors couldn't agree on a codec

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and older browsers don't support &lt;video&gt; at all.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This means &lt;video src="myfile.mp4" /&gt; doesn't work ...

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
until now.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Introducing MediaElement.js, an HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; player

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that looks and works the same in every browser (even iPhone and Android).

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
like the &lt;track&gt; element that enables the subtitles you're reading right now.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Also, new media formats like M(PEG)-DASH and HLS can be played with MediaElement.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Hope you like it.
